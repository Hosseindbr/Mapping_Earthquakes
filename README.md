# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview of The Project
This project involved building an interactive earthquake map using GeoJSON data on earthquakes around the world to support web and mobile application development. JavaScript, D3, and Leaflet were used to traverse GeoJSON files and then plot the data on a Mapbox map according to an API request.

## Resources

* Data Source: Earthquakes GeoJSON, Earthquakes above 4.5mag GeoJSON, Tectonic Plate GeoJSON
* Software: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Visual Studio Code, Leaflet, D3.js 

## Results

Ultimately, we created an interactive map showing all the different earthquakes around the world. Additionaly, an earthquake's magnitude was correlated with the size and color of the circle-marker.

In addition, the map provided a control panel that allowed the user to switch between 3 map styles (darker, satellite, and streets) as well as toggle between earthquakes (on/off), major earthquakes, and the tectonic plates. The bellow figure is displaying the Satellite view with tectonic plates and all earthquakes.

Also, the following figure shows the Dark view with ectonic plates and  major earthquakes being displayed.
